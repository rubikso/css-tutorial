Despite the clear and concise tutorial/blog, it was fairly difficult for me to wrap my mind around the concept, It took me quite some time to learn how to do this and get to a point where I could do it with minimal referencing the video/blog. I spent far more hours getting the proccess down than I would have liked...(somewhere upwards of 20 hours from when I started). I started by copying the code exactly and then playing with the html/css to see what parts affected each other and how it al fell into place. As previously stated, it took me a while to wrap my mind around the overall concept of how it all worked together.
 It took me so long because I spent much of the time watching the video, reading her blog article, and copying what I was seeing. but I didnt want to just copy the material, i wanted to learn it for myself. So I attemtped to recreate the design, but specific to me. That didnt turn out very well to say the least... But I perservered, and after many attemots and failed and deleted html/css files, I am proud to say I got the general idea down and manaaged to re-create the Dropdown Navigation Menu with only a few references to the original (just to work out some kinks towards the end)
 
 
 My overall experience was pretty great (If one ignores the hours of lost sleep and large expanses of time dedicated to this instead of other more fun activities.). the blog and video were excellent at instructing someone on the creation of the design. It is always fun to learn something new, and then to create something with that knowledge and see the end results after many failed attempts, it is something to be cherrished.# css-tuorial
